This is the auxiliary part of Lab 4 that contains examples and challenges from "Data visualization with ggplot2"

#Setup
```
library(tidyverse)

surveys_complete <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv")
```

#Building ggplot
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete)
 
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
```
*adding 'geoms'*
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point()
```
```
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes( x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

surveys_plot+
  geom_point()
```
#Challenge 1
```
install.packages("hexbin")
library(hexbin)

surveys_plot +
  geom_hex()
```
Hexagonal bin plot allows for visualization of observation clusters, but distribution of data points is much harder to notice and map to corresponding x and y axis.

#Building plots iteratively
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point()
```
*adding transparency*
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```
*adding color*
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")
```
*adding color to different values*
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id))
```
#Challenge 2
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = plot_type))
```
#Boxplot
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```
*adding points*
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
```
#Challenge 3
```
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin() +
    scale_y_log10()
```
*boxplot for hindfoot length*
```
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "tomato") +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, color = "sky blue")
```
