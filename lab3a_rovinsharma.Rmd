# Starting with the Data

```
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")              
```

# Challenge 1
```
 str(surveys)
``` 
The class of object "surveys" is data.frame, it has 34786 rows and 13 columns.
There are 48 species, but I am not sure how I could find that from the output of str.
